# Web-programming-H6

Homework 6 for Web programming course.

## The assignment

Using JSP and Servlet, the fourth homework needs to be done.

It is not necessary to have two separate applications! Assistants are still stored in memory but on servlets. Aleksandar should still have zero points.

MVC 2 must be complied with:

* All storage logic should be on the servlet. (Pay attention to concurrency!)
* All display logic should be on the JSP page.

Each for loop on a JSP page should be a JSTL function.
Each expression should be an EL expression.
Print that there is no entry if the list of assistants is empty using JSTL.
